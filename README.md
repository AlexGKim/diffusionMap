### Summary ###

* This repository provides tools for the calculation of Diffusion
Maps. 
* The current implementation is a python wrapper for diffusionMap
Package written in R.  The python package rpy2 (http://rpy.sourceforge.net)
is used to run R within python.  Reference for the R diffusionMap
 package is found at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diffusionMap/index.html.
* The only python call available is the function diffuse.diffuse, which
correponds to the R diffuse function.
* diffuse.test.py is provided as an example of the usage of diffuse.diffuse
